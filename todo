error handling:

don't forget:

done:

0. remove scList.kv file and put into BlankScreen.kv
4. use db_path as a file to read for the db_path
2. add text field in brew.kv for confirmation and error messages
5. make brew and batch fields persistant with screen load like the drop down
7. app opened to blank screen but spinner read "test_screen"; ideally spinner would read "blank_screen" if app opens to blank screen; not critical to app functionality; made all tabs start on blank screen and left default spinner label as "blank_screen"
1. add ability to populate / read data from database
8. screen1.kv file appears unused; if so, delete
3. build mash/lauter fourm

	- new database schema for data fields (jhf, done)
	- add process table in same db based on brand and size (jhf, done)
	- load functionality (done)
	- write functionality (done)
c. verify brand and size exist when adding brew
a. require brew and batch numbers when loading
