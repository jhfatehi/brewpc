todo:

1. ability to populate / read data from database
--example in test_screen completed by kjs

3. build mash/lauter fourm
	- .kv for fourm (jhf, done)
	- new database schema for data fields (jhf, done)
	- add process table in same db based on brand and size (jhf, done)
	- load functionality
	- write functionality

6. add clock with time format hhmm

8. screen1.kv file appears unused; if so, delete

9. add variable dictionary for developers' reference, possibly to readme

10. option to add db_path to .gitignore (also *.db, etc.)

error handling:

a. require brew and batch numbers when loading

b. require data types

c. verify brand and size exist when adding brew


don't forget:

- figure out when to clear test inputs

- figure out window resize option

- drop down for brand and size on add brew which referenced recepie table


Done:

0. remove scList.kv file and put into BlankScreen.kv
4. use db_path as a file to read for the db_path
2. add text field in brew.kv for confirmation and error messages
5. make brew and batch fields persistant with screen load like the drop down
7. app opened to blank screen but spinner read "test_screen"; ideally spinner would read "blank_screen" if app opens to blank screen; not critical to app functionality; made all tabs start on blank screen and left default spinner label as "blank_screen"
