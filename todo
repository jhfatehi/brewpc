todo:

1. load should populate data from database (kjs, in progress)

3. build mash/lauter fourm
	- .kv for fourm (jhf, in progress)
	- new database schema for data fields
	- add recipe table in same db based on brand and size


error handling:

a. require brew and batch numbers when loading

b. require data types

c. verify brand and size exist when adding brew


don't forget:

- figure out when to clear test inputs

- figure out window resize option

- drop down for brand and size on add brew which referenced recepie table


Done:

0. remove scList.kv file and put into BlankScreen.kv
4. use db_path as a file to read for the db_path
2. add text field in brew.kv for confirmation and error messages
5. make brew and batch fields persistant with screen load like the drop down
